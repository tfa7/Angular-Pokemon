2. The services folder contains the following
  - api: contains the api calls to Poke Api and a resolver service that caches the types
  - behaviour-services: used to keep track of the Pokemon filters and sync this data between pokemon-header and pokemon-detail
  - guards: currently only used for changing the page title but this would be mostly used for security

5. The styles folders contain several scss pages that are imported in to the main "styles.scss" file
